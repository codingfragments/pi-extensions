# demo-recording

> **Status: S1 (walking skeleton) done.** It records a hand-written storyboard and narrates it with macOS `say`. Progress is tracked in the [implementation plan](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md#6-vertical-slices).

Automated PoC and demo video recorder for web apps (SPAs, read-mostly):

1. **Brief → discover → storyboard.** The agent explores the app, finds the demo-worthy use cases, and writes a storyboard that reacts to real screen content. You review and approve it in a local side panel.
2. **Record.** One continuous, human-looking take: virtual cursor with realistic motion, realistic typing, and live `improvise` inputs for search and chat.
3. **Analyse → voice-over.** A dense, opinionated, anchored narration written from the actual run. Reviewed in the panel.
4. **Voice, edit, export.** ElevenLabs (custom voice) with OpenAI/Kokoro fallbacks, an audio-led edit, selective zoom, step callouts, and a title card. Per-scene videos plus one combined video.

## What works today (S0–S1)

| In pi | Does |
|---|---|
| `/demo new [<project> <app-url> [app name…]]` | creates a project (stub brief) and opens the panel |
| `/demo open [<project>]` | sets the active project (persisted in the session) |
| `/demo status` | root, config sources, phase, approvals, panel URL |
| `/demo panel` | starts the side panel and prints its URL (with token) |
| `/demo doctor` | prerequisite check |

Engine CLI (no model needed):

```bash
node extensions/demo-recording/cli.ts doctor
node extensions/demo-recording/cli.ts fixture serve            # Acme Pulse test app (?slow=1, ?flaky=1)
node extensions/demo-recording/cli.ts project new --name "Churn PoC" --url https://app.example.com --app "Example"
node extensions/demo-recording/cli.ts panel --ticker           # standalone panel with test events

# S1 walking skeleton: fixture + fixtures/storyboards/s1-search.yaml → out/take-NNN-naive.mp4
node extensions/demo-recording/cli.ts run-s1 --fixture [--seed 7] [--headed]
node extensions/demo-recording/cli.ts run-s1 --url https://app.example.com --app Example --storyboard my.yaml
node extensions/demo-recording/cli.ts spike capture            # capture resolution comparison
```

A take lands in `projects/<p>/takes/take-NNN/` and contains:
- `frames/`: 3200×1800 JPEGs
- `frames.jsonl`
- `events.jsonl`: every step on the screencast clock, with element boxes and `mark` anchors
- `take.json`: seed, stats, status
- `scenes.json`
- `raw.mp4`: CFR master at capture resolution

The S1 storyboard format (a subset; the full schema arrives in S2) is documented in `src/storyboard/types.ts`. See `fixtures/storyboards/s1-search.yaml` for an example.

## Configuration

Optional JSON file at `~/.config/demo-recording/config.json` (or `$DEMO_REC_CONFIG`). Every field is optional:

```json
{
  "root": "~/DemoRecordings",
  "viewport": { "width": 1600, "height": 900, "dpr": 2 },
  "output": { "width": 1920, "height": 1080 },
  "fps": 30,
  "capture": { "quality": 92 },
  "panelPort": 3777,
  "ttsChain": ["elevenlabs", "openai", "kokoro"],
  "voiceName": "My Voice",
  "budgets": { "discoveryScreens": 40, "discoveryActions": 150, "discoveryMinutes": 20 }
}
```

To downscale capture on weaker machines, set `"capture": { "maxWidth": 2560, "maxHeight": 1440 }` (see [docs/spikes/S1-capture.md](docs/spikes/S1-capture.md)).

Environment variables override the file: `DEMO_REC_ROOT`, `DEMO_REC_PANEL_PORT`, `DEMO_REC_TTS_CHAIN` (comma-separated), `DEMO_REC_VOICE`. A malformed config file is a hard error.

## Working directory

```
~/DemoRecordings/
  apps/<app>/        app.json, auth/ (0700), policy.json, discovery/   (shared across demos)
  projects/<demo>/   brief.md, context/, state.json, storyboard/, takes/, vo/, edit/, out/, jobs/
```

Artifacts are versioned and never overwritten (`storyboard/v3.yaml`, `takes/take-002/`).

## Prerequisites

- Node 22+, `npx playwright install chromium`
- `ffmpeg` (with libx264) and `uv` on PATH (`brew install ffmpeg uv`)
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` (primary TTS). Optional: `OPENAI_API_KEY` (fallback TTS / alignment)

`/demo doctor` checks all of these. It reports key *presence* only and never prints values.

## Security notes

- **Panel:** binds to `127.0.0.1` only. API and WebSocket require a random per-session token, and the Host header must be loopback (DNS-rebinding guard). The token is removed from the URL bar once the page loads.
- **Planned (later slices):**
  - Drives a real browser against real apps, including clicks and typing. Discovery uses agent judgment backed by a denylist and an audit log. Lock down sensitive tenants with `policy.json`.
  - Sends screenshots/DOM text to the session model and narration text to TTS providers.
  - Stores browser session state (cookies) per app under `apps/<app>/auth/` (directory `0700`, files `0600`). It is never logged and never sent to models.

## Development

```bash
node --test extensions/demo-recording/test/*.test.ts   # browser/ffmpeg tests skip if missing
DEMO_REC_E2E=1 node --test extensions/demo-recording/test/s1-e2e.test.ts   # full pipeline (macOS)
npm run typecheck && npm run lint
```

The vendored panel dependency (`src/panel/public/vendor/`) is excluded from biome.
